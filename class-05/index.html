        <h2>The Attorney</h2>
        <p>
          I've been an attorney for a decade, a journey that began when I graduated from Duquesne School of Law in 2013. My early career saw me as a dedicated criminal defense litigator, where I honed my legal skills and courtroom expertise. In 2016, I took a significant step by establishing my own practice, where I handled a wide range of cases, specializing in criminal defense and family law. A pivotal moment in my legal career came in 2019 when I became a frequent guest on Court TV, providing legal expertise as a correspondent.

        <h2>The Entrepreneur</h2>
        <p>
          In 2020, I launched a new initiative as an entrepreneur when I officially founded The Dad Firm. This startup venture aimed to address a critical need for self-represented and unwed fathers in Georgia, offering a unique custody coaching web application. My journey as an entrepreneur, however, was not without its challenges. I initially hired two developers to help build The Dad Firm, only to face setbacks when they couldn't complete the work. This experience led me to a critical decision regarding the future of The Dad Firm.

        <h2>The Student</h2>
        <p>
          Recognizing the need for a change in direction, I decided to reassess The Dad Firm project. This reevaluation was not just about the application itself but reflected a realization about my own knowledge and skills. Instead of making the same hiring decisions again, I determined that enhancing my own technical expertise was essential. In 2023, enrolled in the Code Fellows' Software Development Certification program and began the path of a student.
