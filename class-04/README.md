## About Me (Pair Programming)
10.26.23

I continued to build off of your lab 02 by adding additional functionality to my About Me Guessing Game. If you'll remember,in lab 02, I created a webpage that quizzes users on five facts about me, using JavaScript. The HTML/CSS allows the webpage to display basic information about me to the user.

### Reflections and Comments

Brendan Huddleston was the driver for the pair programming assignment, and I, the owner of the repo, was the navigator.

How did the pair programming process go in general?

It went well after we got the hang of it. We did an assessment of my code first, since we figured it would be most challenging. Brendan was very patient and willing to troubleshoot a lot of my code. It felt impossible to just let him navigate the code, without me working on it as well on my own computer. Especially, when we got stuck. I found myself researching and having to pull up my code to play around with it to see if some changes would work. 

Did you learn anything from your partner? If so, what?
Yes, Brendan is pretty good with functions. He said think of functions as boxes and that was helpful in my understanding of its usefulness. We were also able to troubleshoot my array loop, that wasn't working properly. He suggested that I make my array lowercase, and that was the actual fix.

What was the most difficult part of the assignment today?
We really wanted to add parameters to our functions. But we had difficulty figuring out how to do that. It was also difficult to instruct another person on what to (how to fix the code), without adjusting the code myself. 

What was the easiest part of the assignment today?
My partner was incredibly easy to work with. And when we hit a brick wall, we both agreed to call a TA. So I think we cooperated well together. 

Anything else youâ€™d like to share?
Yes, I'm still not confident in my ability to create a complex function, like the one I attempted for my quiz, without outside help. I had to rely on W3 schools a lot. And replit.  

How long did it take you to complete this assignment? 
It took us about three hours and fifteen minutes to complete. 

And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
Who knows. I knew it would take a long time. Everything does lol.

Day 4 Learning Journal:

Today's class in the 201 Course left me feeling overwhelmed. We delved into the topic of functions in JavaScript, which is something that has been a challenge for me ever since Course 102. As the day went on, I realized that my understanding of functions is still far from where I'd like it to be, and it made the lab exercise particularly tough.

My primary goal for the lab was to encapsulate the entire quiz I had coded into a function. However, the concept of parameters continues to trip me up, and as a result, I ended up creating a separate function for each quiz question. Deep down, I know this isn't the most efficient way to approach the problem, but I couldn't figure out how to do it any other way. The frustration began to set in as I tried to navigate this challenge.

It's disheartening because I'm aware that I am learning, and progress is being made. However, there are certain concepts that just don't seem to click completely, especially when it comes to applying my knowledge to practical exercises like this one. I wish I had more time outside of class to study and practice. Sadly, it feels like I'm constantly racing against the clock.

I find myself staying up late, struggling to meet daily assignment deadlines, and it's taking a toll on my sleep schedule. As I reflect on the day, it's clear to me that I'll need to make some sacrifices to find more time for practice. It might mean rearranging my daily schedule or allocating specific hours just for focused studying. While it feels overwhelming right now, I know that this extra effort is essential for my growth as a developer.

In the end, today was a challenging day, and it left me feeling overwhelmed. However, I understand that these struggles are a part of the learning process, and I am committed to pushing through them and improving my understanding of JavaScript functions.
