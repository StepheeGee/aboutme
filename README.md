## About Me

I created a webpage that quizzes users on five facts about me, using JavaScript. The HTML/CSS allows the webpage to display basic information about me to the user.

### Reflections and Comments

This was rough for me. I couldn't get my js to work for like an hour because I forgot to comment out the comment out the full set of code from my first try. Also, the nested if else statements got really confusing. I had to draw an actual diagram to figure out where I was going. My validation kept messing up, which was frustrating. Especially when I went back to add alerts instead of just console.log. One issue that I know I've created is that if the correct name is not entered, the user receives an alert to enter the correct name. But it's not a prompt. So I have to fix that. 

I've learned that I have to pay attention and not make simple mistakes of omission. I also learned that when you 'use strict' JS, you can't use name as a variable. I had to use userName. I also learned that files that start with dot are hidden. So I had to get help from a TA to locate the configuration files. 

It took me about 5 hours to complete this. And I didn't know how long it would take, but I wish it hadn't taken so long. I'm frustrated at this point.
