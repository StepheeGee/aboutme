## About Me (Extended)
10.25.23

I continues to build off of your lab 02 by adding additional functionality to my About Me Guessing Game. If you'll remember,in lab 02, I created a webpage that quizzes users on five facts about me, using JavaScript. The HTML/CSS allows the webpage to display basic information about me to the user.

### Reflections and Comments

I tried a lot of new concepts today and they were really difficult so it took a bit of time. I've been working on this assignment since about 4pm, and I'm finishing now at 11:15pm. I do feel like I learned a lot about the fundamentals. Especially with JavaScript. The arrays and loops are always tricky for me. So that took some time and research. But I completed it, and it works. I also had to take some time to unravel some of the work I did yesterday on lab 2. Because this lab required us to keep score of the correct guesses, yesterday's questions, which were nested conditional logic, had to be separated. 

Learning Journal:
The first thing that comes to mind is that I've attended law school and that has helped me considerably with adjusting to learning something new - software development. 

I started law school when I was 23 and I really didn't understand what type of rigorous training I was walking into. It was so intimidating. Professors used the socratic method to call on students for answers; and not knowing the answer was the epitome of humiliation. I remember two months into the first semester thinking, Oh I'm gonna fail if I don't get some courage. And so I did. Get courage. Not fail. 

This experience reminds me of that - sitting in class, feeling lost, not knowing the answer, and not wanting to look stupid in front of the class. It's easier this time to find my courage to speak up and gain clarity because I went to law school. And I'll always remember that I can never feel more stupid than I felt back then. But I worked hard, I adjusted, and I did well. And that's my hope this time around too.
